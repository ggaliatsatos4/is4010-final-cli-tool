# AI-Assisted Development

## AI Tools Used
- **GitHub Copilot**: Code completion and boilerplate generation
- **ChatGPT**: Helped with debugging and code examples
- **Gemini**: Planning and architecture suggestions

## Example Prompts and Results
**Prompt:** "How do I create a CLI in Python that reads and writes JSON?"
**Result:** Copilot suggested a working structure with argparse, JSON read/write, and helper functions.

## Reflection
Using AI helped me save time on boilerplate and learn new Python patterns faster. I verified and understood all AI suggestions before using them.
